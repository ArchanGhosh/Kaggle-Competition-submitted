# Kaggle-Competition-submitted

This si my official Repo for all the Future Kaggle competitions that I will be taking Part in.

My First was ConnectX which is available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx

The ipnyb file has the original code, you just have to create a new Notebook while taking part and upload this ipnyb.
